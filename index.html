      <h1>ESP - Environmental Surveying Platform</h1>
      <p>
        The concept for our project is in the scope of all the vehicles
        mentioned in the previous section. Our team aimed to design a vehicle
        capable of semi-autonomous driving and navigation with a feature rich
        GUI for statistics and control. This vehicle has an abundance of sensors
        on it to gather data about the surrounding environment. These sensors
        include: temperature sensors, humidity sensors, oxygen sensors, carbon
        dioxide sensors, ultraviolet sensors, particulate matter sensors,
        volatile organic compound sensors, ozone sensors, light sensors,
        ultrasonic (proximity) sensors, and a Kinect for object detection. This
        data will aid in the study of the condition of the environment, and also
        give us insight to the habitability of the areas the vehicle traversed.
